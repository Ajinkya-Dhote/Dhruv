Each of the logging methods {@link module:sap/base/Log.debug}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.info}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.warning}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.error} and {@link module:sap/base/Log.fatal} creates and records a log entry, containing a timestamp, a log level, a message with details and a component info. The log level will be one of {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level} and equals the name of the concrete logging method.\n\nBy using the {@link module:sap/base/Log.setLevel} method, consumers can determine the least important log level which should be recorded. Less important entries will be filtered out. (Note that higher numeric values represent less important levels). The initially set level depends on the mode that UI5 is running in. When the optimized sources are executed, the default level will be {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level.ERROR}. For normal (debug sources), the default level is {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level.DEBUG}.\n\nAll logging methods allow to specify a <b>component</b>. These components are simple strings and don't have a special meaning to the UI5 framework. However they can be used to semantically group log entries that belong to the same software component (or feature). There are two APIs that help to manage logging for such a component. With {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLogger}, one can retrieve a logger that automatically adds the given <code>sComponent</code> as component parameter to each log entry, if no other component is specified. Typically, JavaScript code will retrieve such a logger once during startup and reuse it for the rest of its lifecycle. Second, the {@link module:sap/base/Log.Logger#setLevel}(iLevel, sComponent) method allows to set the log level for a specific component only. This allows a more fine granular control about the created logging entries. {@link module:sap/base/Log.Logger#getLevel} allows to retrieve the currently effective log level for a given component.\n\n{@link module:sap/base/Log.getLogEntries} returns an array of the currently collected log entries.\n\nFurthermore, a listener can be registered to the log. It will be notified whenever a new entry is added to the log. The listener can be used for displaying log entries in a separate page area, or for sending it to some external target (server).","type":"class","static":false,"visibility":"public","since":"1.58"},{"control":"module:sap/base/security/encodeCSS","text":"Encode the string for inclusion into CSS string literals or identifiers.","type":"class","static":false,"visibility":"public","since":"1.58"},{"control":"module:sap/base/security/encodeJS","text":"Encode the string for inclusion into a JS string literal.","type":"class","static":false,"visibility":"public","since":"1.58"},{"control":"module:sap/base/security/encodeURL","text":"Encode the string for inclusion into a URL parameter.\n\nUnescaped characters: alphabetic, decimal digits, -_.

All elements added to the source aggregation will be located at the target aggregation (this means the target instance is their parent). Both, source and target element will return the added elements when asked for the content of the respective aggregation.

The result is similar - all added/bound items will reside at the target - but when the binding is forwarded, the updateAggregation method is called on the target element and the add/remove methods are only called on the target element as well.\n\nAggregations can only be forwarded to other aggregations of the same multiplicity (single/multiple). The target aggregation must also be \"compatible\" to the source aggregation in the sense that any items given to the source aggregation must also be valid in the target aggregation (otherwise the target element will throw a validation error).\n\nIf the forwarded elements use data binding, the target element must be properly aggregated by the source element to make sure all models are available there as well (this is anyway important to avoid issues).\n\nThe aggregation target must remain the same instance across the entire lifetime of the source control.\n\nAggregation forwarding must be set up before any instances of the control are created (recommended: within the class definition) to avoid situations where forwarding is not yet set up when the first aggregated item is added.\n\nAggregation forwarding will behave unexpectedly when the content in the target aggregation is modified by other actors (e.g. by the target element or by another forwarding from a different source aggregation).

This is to ensure that whenever the size of a child control changes, the overflow toolbar's layout is recalculated. Some properties however do not affect control size, making it unnecessary to invalidate the overflow toolbar when they change. You can list them here for optimization purposes.</li>\n\n<li><code>onBeforeEnterOverflow(oControl)</code> - A callback function that will be invoked before moving the control into the overflow menu. The control instance will be passed as an argument.\n\n<b>Note:</b> The context of the function is not the control instance (use the <code>oControl</code> parameter for this purpose), but rather an internal helper object, associated with the current <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbar</code> instance. This object only needs to be manipulated in special cases (e.g. when you want to store state on it, rather than on the control instance).</li>\n\n<li><code>onAfterExitOverflow(oControl)</code> - A callback function that will be invoked after taking the control out of the overflow menu (before moving it back to the toolbar itself). The control instance will be passed as an argument.\n\n<b>Note:</b> See: <code>onBeforeEnterOverflow</code> for details about the function's context.</li>\n\n<li><code>getCustomImportance()</code> - A function that, if provided, will be called to determine the priority of the control. This function must return a value of type <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbarPriority</code>.

In summary, implementing this function allows a control to override the default priority logic (<code>sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData</code>) by providing its own.</li> </ul>\n\n<b>Important:</b> In addition, the control can implement a CSS class, scoped with the <code>.sapMOverflowToolbarMenu-CTX</code> context selector, that will be applied whenever the control is inside the overflow menu.

If the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library is not loaded before the <code>DateTimePicker</code> is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the <code>DateTimePicker</code> is opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the <code>DateTimePicker</code> should also load the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library.\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\nUse this control if you need a combined date and time input control.\n\nDon't use it if you want to use either a date or a time value. In this case, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker} or the {@link sap.m.TimePicker} controls instead.\n\nThe user can enter a date by: <ul> <li>Using the calendar or a time selector that opens in a popup</li> <li>Typing it in directly in the input field</li></ul>\n\nOn app level, there are two options to provide a date for the <code>DateTimePicker</code> - as a string to the <code>value</code> property or as a JavaScript Date object to the <code>dateValue</code> property (only one of these properties should be used at a time):\n\n<ul><li>Use the <code>value</code> property if you want to bind the <code>DateTimePicker</code> to a model using the <code>sap.ui.model.type.DateTime</code></li> <li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for example, as ABAP type DATS field)</li> <li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want to work with a JavaScript Date object. Use <code>dateValue</code> as a helper property to easily obtain the day, month, year, hours, minutes and seconds of the chosen date and time. Although possible to bind it, the recommendation is not to do it. When binding is needed, use <code>value</code> property instead</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Formatting</h3>\n\nAll formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}. If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.\n\nSupported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}\n\nFor example, if the <code>valueFormat</code> is \"yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss\", the <code>displayFormat</code> is \"MMM d, y, HH:mm:ss\", and the used locale is English, a valid value string is \"2015-07-30-10-30-15\", which leads to an output of \"Jul 30, 2015, 10:30:15\".\n\nIf no placeholder is set to the <code>DateTimePicker</code>, the used <code>displayFormat</code> is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.\n\n<b>Note:</b> If the string does NOT match the <code>displayFormat</code> (from user input) or the <code>valueFormat</code> (on app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.\n\n<h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n\nThe <code>DateTimePicker</code> is responsive and fully adapts to all devices. For larger screens, such as tablet or desktop, it opens as a popover.

If you want to control the execution time of an operation, for example a function import named \"GetNumberOfAvailableItems\", create a context binding for the path \"/GetNumberOfAvailableItems(...)\" (as specified here, including the three dots). Such an operation binding is <i>deferred</i>, meaning that it does not request automatically, but only when you call {@link #execute}. {@link #refresh} is always ignored for actions and action imports.

Also, every path described in \"14.5.2 Expression edm:AnnotationPath\", \"14.5.11 Expression edm:NavigationPropertyPath\", \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\", and \"14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath\" is a valid relative path within the metadata model if a suitable prefix is added which addresses an entity container, entity set, singleton, complex type, entity type, or property; for example \"/MySchema.MyEntityType/MyProperty\" + \"@vCard.Address#work/FullName\".\n\nThe absolute path is split into segments and followed step-by-step, starting at the global scope of all known qualified OData names. There are two technical properties there: \"$Version\" (typically \"4.0\") and \"$EntityContainer\" with the name of the single entity container for this metadata model's service.\n\nAn empty segment in between is invalid. An empty segment at the end caused by a trailing slash differentiates between a name and the object it refers to. This way, \"/$EntityContainer\" refers to the name of the single entity container and \"/$EntityContainer/\" refers to the single entity container as an object.\n\nThe segment \"@sapui.name\" refers back to the last OData name (simple identifier or qualified name) or annotation name encountered during path traversal immediately before \"@sapui.name\": <ul> <li> \"/EMPLOYEES@sapui.name\" results in \"EMPLOYEES\" and \"/EMPLOYEES/@sapui.name\" results in the same as \"/EMPLOYEES/$Type\", that is, the qualified name of the entity set's type (see below how \"$Type\" is inserted implicitly). Note how the separating slash again makes a difference here. <li> \"/EMPLOYEES/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label@sapui.name\" results in \"@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label\" and a slash does not make any difference as long as the annotation does not have a \"$Type\" property. <li> A technical property (that is, a numerical segment or one starting with a \"$\") immediately before \"@sapui.name\" is invalid, for example \"/$EntityContainer@sapui.name\". </ul> The path must not continue after \"@sapui.name\".\n\nIf the current object is a string value, that string value is treated as a relative path and followed step-by-step before the next segment is processed. Except for this, a path must not continue if it comes across a non-object value. Such a string value can be a qualified name (example path \"/$EntityContainer/...\"), a simple identifier (example path \"/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/...\") or even a path according to \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\" etc. (example path \"/TEAMS/$Type/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/...\").\n\nSegments starting with an \"@\" character, for example \"@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label\", address annotations at the current object. As the first segment, they refer to the single entity container. For objects which can only be annotated inline (see \"14.3 Element edm:Annotation\" minus \"14.2.1 Attribute Target\"), the object already contains the annotations as a property. For objects which can (only or also) be annotated via external targeting, the object does not contain any annotation as a property. Such annotations MUST be accessed via a path. BEWARE of a special case: Actions, functions and their parameters can be annotated inline for a single overload or via external targeting for all overloads at the same time. In this case, the object contains all annotations for the single overload as a property, but annotations MUST nevertheless be accessed via a path in order to include also annotations for all overloads at the same time.\n\nSegments starting with an OData name followed by an \"@\" character, for example \"/TEAMS@Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.TopSupported\", address annotations at an entity set, singleton, or property, not at the corresponding type. In contrast, \"/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Deletable\" (note the separating slash) addresses an annotation at the entity set's type. This is in line with the special rule of \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\" regarding annotations at a navigation property itself.\n\n\"@\" can be used as a segment to address a map of all annotations of the current object. This is useful for iteration, for example via <code>&lt;template:repeat list=\"{entityType>@}\" ...></code>.\n\nAnnotations of an annotation are addressed not by two separate segments, but by a single segment like \"@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.TextArrangement\". Each annotation can have a qualifier, for example \"@first#foo@second#bar\". Note: If the first annotation's value is a record, a separate segment addresses an annotation of that record, not an annotation of the first annotation itself. In a similar way, annotations of \"7.2 Element edm:ReferentialConstraint\", \"7.3 Element edm:OnDelete\", \"10.2 Element edm:Member\" and \"14.5.14.2 Element edm:PropertyValue\" are addressed by segments like \"&lt;7.2.1 Attribute Property>@...\", \"$OnDelete@...\", \"&lt;10.2.1 Attribute Name>@...\" and \"&lt;14.5.14.2.1 Attribute Property>@...\" (where angle brackets denote a variable part and sections refer to specification \"OData Version 4.0 Part 3: Common Schema Definition Language\").\n\nAnnotations starting with \"@@\", for example \"@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.isMultiple\" or \"@@.AH.isMultiple\" or \"@@.isMultiple\", represent computed annotations. Their name without the \"@@\" prefix must refer to a function in <code>mParameters.scope</code> in case of a relative name starting with a dot, which is stripped before lookup; see the <code>&lt;template:alias></code> instruction for XML Templating. In case of an absolute name, it is searched in <code>mParameters.scope</code> first and then in the global namespace. This function is called with the current object (or primitive value) and additional details and returns the result of this {@link #requestObject} call. The additional details are given as an object with the following properties: <ul> <li><code>{boolean} $$valueAsPromise</code> Whether the computed annotation may return a <code>Promise</code> resolving with its value (since 1.57.0) <li><code>{@link sap.ui.model.Context} context</code> Points to the current object <li><code>{string} schemaChildName</code> The qualified name of the schema child where the computed annotation has been found </ul> Computed annotations cannot be iterated by \"@\". The path must not continue after a computed annotation.\n\nA segment which represents an OData qualified name is looked up in the global scope (\"scope lookup\") and thus determines a schema child which is used later on. Unknown qualified names are invalid. This way, \"/acme.DefaultContainer/EMPLOYEES\" addresses the \"EMPLOYEES\" child of the schema child named \"acme.DefaultContainer\". This also works indirectly (\"/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES\") and implicitly (\"/EMPLOYEES\", see below).\n\nA segment which represents an OData simple identifier needs special preparations. The same applies to the empty segment after a trailing slash. <ol> <li> If the current object has a \"$Action\", \"$Function\" or \"$Type\" property, it is used for scope lookup first. This way, \"/EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE\" addresses the same object as \"/EMPLOYEES/$Type/ENTRYDATE\", namely the \"ENTRYDATE\" child of the entity type corresponding to the \"EMPLOYEES\" child of the entity container. The other cases jump from an action or function import to the corresponding action or function overloads. <li> Else if the segment is the first one within its path, the last schema child addressed via scope lookup is used instead of the current object. This can only happen indirectly as in \"/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/...\" where the schema child is the entity container and the navigation property binding can contain the simple identifier of another entity set within the same container.\n\nIf the segment is the first one overall, \"$EntityContainer\" is inserted into the path implicitly. In other words, the entity container is used as the initial schema child. This way, \"/EMPLOYEES\" addresses the same object as \"/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES\", namely the \"EMPLOYEES\" child of the entity container. <li> Afterwards, if the current object is an array, it represents overloads for an action or function. Multiple overloads are invalid. The overload's \"$ReturnType/$Type\" is used for scope lookup. This way, \"/GetOldestWorker/AGE\" addresses the same object as \"/GetOldestWorker/0/$ReturnType/$Type/AGE\". For primitive return types, the special segment \"value\" can be used to refer to the return type itself (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute}). This way, \"/GetOldestAge/value\" addresses the same object as \"/GetOldestAge/0/$ReturnType\" (which is needed for automatic type determination, see {@link #requestUI5Type}). </ol>\n\nA trailing slash can be used to continue a path and thus force scope lookup or OData simple identifier preparations, but then stay at the current object. This way, \"/EMPLOYEES/$Type/\" addresses the entity type itself corresponding to the \"EMPLOYEES\" child of the entity container. Although the empty segment is not an OData simple identifier, it can be used as a placeholder for one. In this way, \"/EMPLOYEES/\" addresses the same entity type as \"/EMPLOYEES/$Type/\". That entity type in turn is a map of all its OData children (that is, structural and navigation properties) and determines the set of possible child names that might be used after the trailing slash.\n\nAny other segment, including an OData simple identifier, is looked up as a property of the current object.","type":"methods","static":false,"visibility":"public","entityName":"requestObject","since":"1.37.0"},{"control":"sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataMetaModel","text":"Requests the UI5 type for the given property path that formats and parses corresponding to the property's EDM type and constraints.

A '##' is recognized as separator in the resolved path and splits it into two parts; note that '#' may also be used as separator but is deprecated since 1.51. The part before the separator is transformed into a metadata context (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataMetaModel#getMetaContext}).

If you want the user to select a duration (1 hour), use the {@link sap.m.Select} control instead.\n\nThe user can enter a date by:\n\n<ul><li>Using the <code>TimePicker</code> dropdown that opens in a popup</li> <li>Typing it in directly in the input field</li></ul>\n\nOn app level, there are two options to provide value for the <code>TimePicker</code> - as a string to the <code>value</code> property or as a JavaScript Date object to the <code>dateValue</code> property (only one of these properties should be used at a time):\n\n<ul><li>Use the <code>value</code> property if you want to bind the <code>TimePicker</code> to a model using the <code>sap.ui.model.type.Time</code></li> <li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for example, as ABAP type DATS field)</li> <li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want to work with a JavaScript Date object. Use <code>dateValue</code> as a helper property to easily obtain the hours, minutes and seconds of the chosen time. Although possible to bind it, the recommendation is to not to do it. When binding is needed, use <code>value</code> property instead</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Formatting</h3>\n\nAll formatting and parsing of values from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}. If a value is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used time format and locale.\n\nSupported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}\n\nA time format must be specified, otherwise the default \"HH:mm:ss a\" will be used. For example, if the <code>valueFormat</code> is \"HH-mm-ss a\", the <code>displayFormat</code> is \"HH:mm:ss a\", and the used locale is English, a valid value string is \"10-30-15 AM\", which leads to an output of \"10:30:15 AM\".\n\nIf no placeholder is set to the <code>TimePicker</code>, the used <code>displayFormat</code> is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.\n\n<b>Note:</b> If the string does NOT match the <code>displayFormat</code> (from user input) or the <code>valueFormat</code> (on app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.\n\n<h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n\nThe <code>TimePicker</code> is responsive and fully adapts to all device types.

The message popover is triggered from a messaging button in the footer toolbar. If an error has occurred at any validation point, the total number of messages should be incremented, but the user's work shouldn't be interrupted. Navigation between the message item and the source of the error can be created, if needed by the application. This can be done by setting the <code>activeTitle</code> property to true and providing a handler for the <code>activeTitlePress</code> event. In addition, you can achieve the same functionality inside a different container using the sap.m.MessageView control. <h3>Responsive Behavior</h3> On mobile phones, the message popover is automatically shown in full screen mode.<br> On desktop and tablet, the message popover opens in a popover.<br> On desktop the opened popover is resizable if it is placed in a {@link sap.m.Toolbar}, {@link sap.m.Bar} or used in {@link sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage}","type":"class","static":true,"visibility":"public","since":"1.28"},{"control":"sap.m.MessagePopoverItem","text":"Items provide information about Error Messages in the page.","type":"class","static":true,"visibility":"public","since":"1.28"},{"control":"sap.m.MultiInput","text":"Close multi-line MultiInput in multi-line mode","type":"methods","static":false,"visibility":"public","entityName":"closeMultiLine","since":"1.28"},{"control":"sap.m.MultiInput","text":"Gets current value of property {@link #getEnableMultiLineMode enableMultiLineMode}.\n\nIf set to true, the MultiInput will be displayed in multi-line display mode.

When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current {@link sap.ui.loader.config configuration}. The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level <code>sap.ui.define</code> call.\n\nIf the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was given as <code>vFactory</code>, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and its return value will be used as module export value. The framework internally associates the resulting value with the module ID and provides it to the original requester of the module. Whenever the module is requested again, the same export value will be returned (modules are executed only once).\n\n<i>Example:</i><br> The following example defines a module, but doesn't hard code the module ID. If stored in a file 'sap/mylib/SomeClass.js', it can be requested with the ID 'sap/mylib/SomeClass'. <pre>\n  sap.ui.define(['./Helper', 'sap/m/Bar'], function(Helper,Bar) {\n\n    // create a new class\n    var SomeClass = function() {};\n\n    // add methods to its prototype\n    SomeClass.prototype.foo = function() {\n\n        // use a function from the dependency 'Helper' in the same package (e.g. 'sap/mylib/Helper' )\n        var mSettings = Helper.foo();\n\n        // create and return an sap.m.Bar (using its local name 'Bar')\n        return new Bar(mSettings);\n\n    }\n\n    // return the class as module value\n    return SomeClass;\n\n  });\n</pre>\n\nIn another module or in an application HTML page, the {@link sap.ui.require} API can be used to load the sap/mylib/Something module and to work with it:\n\n<pre>\nsap.ui.require(['sap/mylib/Something'], function(Something) {\n\n  // instantiate a Something and call foo() on it\n  new Something().foo();\n\n});\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Module Name Syntax</h3>\n\n<code>sap.ui.define</code> uses a simplified variant of the {@link jQuery.sap.getResourcePath unified resource name} syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax is, that for <code>sap.ui.define</code> and <code>sap.ui.require</code>, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.\n\nAs a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).\n\nIt is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.\n\n<h3>Dependency to Modules</h3>\n\nIf a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies array.\n\n<b>Note:</b> The order in which the dependency modules are <i>executed</i> is <b>not</b> defined by the order in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies <i>between</i> the dependency modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution order (other than expressed by their dependencies).\n\n<b>Note:</b> A static module export (a literal provided to <code>sap.ui.define</code>) cannot depend on the module exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function, potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.\n\n<h3>Asynchronous Contract</h3>\n\n<code>sap.ui.define</code> is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific test scenario.\n\nFor example, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must not use the module export value immediately after invoking <code>sap.ui.define</code>:\n\n<pre>\n  // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT\n\n  // define a class Something as AMD module\n  sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {\n    var Something = function() {};\n    return Something;\n  });\n\n  // DON'T DO THAT!\n  // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called\n  new Something();\n\n</pre>\n\nApplications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.\n\n<h3>(No) Global References</h3>\n\nTo be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with <code>sap.ui.define</code> should not make any use of global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.\n\nAs the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel to the old global names. The fourth parameter of <code>sap.ui.define</code> has been added to support that transition phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features\n\n<ol> <li>Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current module is ensured</li> <li>The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under the global name which is derived from the ID of the module</li> </ol>\n\nThe parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.\n\n<h3>Third Party Modules</h3> Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies in a <code>sap.ui.define</code> call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports available, so called <em>shims</em> have to be defined.\n\nNote that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.\n\nFor third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace <code>sap/ui/thirdparty/</code>), the necessary shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module <code>ui5loader-autoconfig.js</code> during bootstrap.\n\nExample: <pre>\n  // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'\n  // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'\n  // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value\n  // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js\n  sap.ui.loader.config({\n    shim: {\n      'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {\n         amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders\n         exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  // now the module can be retrieved like other modules\n  sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {\n\n    new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)\n\n    ...\n  });\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Differences to Standard AMD</h3>\n\nThe current implementation of <code>sap.ui.define</code> differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api) or from concrete AMD loaders like <code>requireJS</code> in several aspects: <ul> <li>The name <code>sap.ui.define</code> is different from the plain <code>define</code>. This has two reasons: first, it avoids the impression that <code>sap.ui.define</code> is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one application as long as UI5 or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect methods <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax, can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them using the <code>amd:true</code> flag (see example above)</li> <li>Depending on configuration and the current context, <code>sap.ui.define</code> loads the dependencies of a module either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs like {@link jQuery.sap.require}.</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not planned to support this in future</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).</li> <li><code>sap.ui.define</code> does <b>not</b> support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations using <code>sap.ui.require(\"something\")</code> are automagically converted into <code>sap.ui.define</code> dependencies before executing the factory function.</li> </ul>\n\n<h3>Limitations, Design Considerations</h3> <ul> <li><b>Limitation</b>: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously, this only works as long as <code>sap.ui.define</code> uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous loading is implemented.</li> <li>It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync <code>jQuery.sap.require</code> call can load a <code>sap.ui.define</code>'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously, the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)</li> <li>A single file must not contain multiple calls to <code>sap.ui.define</code>. Multiple calls currently are only supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract</li> </ul>","type":"methods","static":true,"visibility":"public","entityName":"define","since":"1.27.0"},{"control":"sap.ui.base.ManagedObjectMetadata","text":"Returns an info object for the named public aggregation of the described class no matter whether the aggregation was defined by the class itself or by one of its ancestor classes.\n\nIf neither the class nor its ancestor classes define a public aggregation with the given name, <code>undefined</code> is returned.\n\nIf the name is not given (or has a falsy value), then it is substituted by the name of the default aggregation of the 'described class' (if any).\n\n<b>Warning:</b> Type, structure and behavior of the returned info objects is not documented and therefore not part of the API.

Candidates for such formatter functions are all those used in binding expressions which are evaluated during XML template processing, including those used inside template instructions like <code>&lt;template:if></code>. The formatter function needs to be marked with a property <code>requiresIContext = true</code> to express that it requires this extended signature (compared to ordinary formatter functions). The usual arguments are provided after the first one (currently: the raw value from the model).\n\nThis interface provides callback functions to access the model and path which are needed to process OData V4 annotations. It initially offers a subset of methods from {@link sap.ui.model.Context} so that formatters might also be called with a context object for convenience, e.g. outside of XML template processing (see below for an exception to this rule).\n\n<b>Example:</b> Suppose you have a formatter function called \"foo\" like below and it is used within an XML template like <code>&lt;template:if test=\"{path: '...', formatter: 'foo'}\"></code>. In this case <code>foo</code> is called with arguments <code>oInterface, vRawValue</code> such that <code>oInterface.getModel().getObject(oInterface.getPath()) === vRawValue</code> holds. <pre>\nwindow.foo = function (oInterface, vRawValue) {\n    //TODO ...\n};\nwindow.foo.requiresIContext = true;\n</pre>\n\n<b>Composite Binding Examples:</b> Suppose you have the same formatter function and it is used in a composite binding like <code>&lt;Text text=\"{path: 'Label', formatter: 'foo'}: {path: 'Value', formatter: 'foo'}\"/></code>. In this case <code>oInterface.getPath()</code> refers to \".../Label\" in the 1st call and \".../Value\" in the 2nd call. This means each formatter call knows which part of the composite binding it belongs to and behaves just as if it was an ordinary binding.\n\nSuppose your formatter is not used within a part of the composite binding, but at the root of the composite binding in order to aggregate all parts like <code> &lt;Text text=\"{parts: [{path: 'Label'}, {path: 'Value'}], formatter: 'foo'}\"/></code>. In this case <code>oInterface.getPath(0)</code> refers to \".../Label\" and <code>oInterface.getPath(1)</code> refers to \".../Value\". This means, the root formatter can access the ith part of the composite binding at will (since 1.31.0); see also {@link #.getInterface getInterface}. The function <code>foo</code> is called with arguments such that <code> oInterface.getModel(i).getObject(oInterface.getPath(i)) === arguments[i + 1]</code> holds. This use is not supported within an expression binding, that is, <code>&lt;Text text=\"{= ${parts: [{path: 'Label'}, {path: 'Value'}], formatter: 'foo'} }\"/></code> does not work as expected because the property <code>requiresIContext = true</code> is ignored.\n\nTo distinguish those two use cases, just check whether <code>oInterface.getModel() === undefined</code>, in which case the formatter is called on root level of a composite binding. To find out the number of parts, probe for the smallest non-negative integer where <code>oInterface.getModel(i) === undefined</code>.

But in some cases it makes sense that a control only renders a subset of its children based on some criterion. For example, a typical carousel control might, for performance reasons, only render the currently visible children (and maybe some child before and after the visible area to facilitate slide-in / slide-out animations), but not all children. This leads to situations where a child had been rendered before, but shouldn't be rendered anymore after an update of the carousel's position. The DOM related state of that child then must be cleaned up correctly, e.g. by de-registering resize handlers or native event handlers. <code>cleanupControlWithoutRendering</code> helps with that task by triggering the same activities that the normal rendering triggers before the rendering of a control (e.g. it fire the <code>BeforeRendering</code> event). It just doesn't call the renderer and the control will not receive an <code>AfterRendering</code> event.\n\nThe following example shows how <code>renderControl</code> and <code>cleanupControlWithoutRendering</code> should be used:\n\n<pre>\n  CarouselRenderer.render = function(rm, oCarousel){\n\n    ...\n\n    oCarousel.getPages().forEach( oPage ) {\n       if ( oCarousel.isPageToBeRendered( oPage ) ) {\n          rm.renderControl( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering, render, later onAfterRendering\n       } else {\n          rm.cleanupControlWithoutRendering( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering\n       }\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n  };\n</pre>\n\n<h3>DOM Removal</h3> The method does not remove the DOM of the given control. The caller of this method has to take care to remove it at some later point in time. It should indeed be <i>later</i>, not <i>before</i> as the <code>onBeforeRendering</code> hook of the control might need access to the old DOM for a proper cleanup.\n\nFor parents which are rendered with the normal mechanism as shown in the example above, the removal of the old child DOM is guaranteed. The whole DOM of the parent control (including the DOM of the no longer rendered child) will be replaced with new DOM (no longer containing the child) when the rendering cycle finishes.\n\n<b>Note:</b>: the functionality of this method is different from the default handling for invisible controls (controls with <code>visible == false</code>).

Whether a dialog is regarded as \"enabled\" during the state transitions (OPENING, CLOSING) is not fully decided. Currently, it is enabled during the OPENING phase and disabled during the CLOSING phase. The only potential change would be to treat the OPENING phase as disabled as well. Applications should be prepared to receive events from \"enabled\" controls after they called open() on the dialog until close() is called on it. If the mentioned potential change should happen, the dialog will become enabled only after the transition to OPEN. Events from \"enabled\" children then can still only arrive between open() and close(), so applications that obey the previous rule should continue to work.

They then receive the same complex result object as for the sjax() call.","type":"methods","static":true,"visibility":"public","entityName":"syncGetText","since":"0.9.0"},{"control":"jQuery.sap","text":"Convenience wrapper for {@link jQuery.sap.sjax} that enforces the Http method POST and defaults the data type of the result to 'text'.","type":"methods","static":true,"visibility":"public","entityName":"syncPost","since":"0.9.0"},{"control":"jQuery.sap.KeyCodes","text":"Enumeration of key codes.","type":"class","static":true,"visibility":"public","since":"0.9.0"},{"control":"jQuery.sap.log","text":"A Logging API for JavaScript.\n\nProvides methods to manage a client-side log and to create entries in it. Each of the logging methods {@link jQuery.sap.log.debug}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.info}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.warning}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.error} and {@link jQuery.sap.log.fatal} creates and records a log entry, containing a timestamp, a log level, a message with details and a component info. The log level will be one of {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level} and equals the name of the concrete logging method.\n\nBy using the {@link jQuery.sap.log.setLevel} method, consumers can determine the least important log level which should be recorded. Less important entries will be filtered out. (Note that higher numeric values represent less important levels). The initially set level depends on the mode that UI5 is running in. When the optimized sources are executed, the default level will be {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level.ERROR}. For normal (debug sources), the default level is {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level.DEBUG}.\n\nAll logging methods allow to specify a <b>component</b>. These components are simple strings and don't have a special meaning to the UI5 framework. However they can be used to semantically group log entries that belong to the same software component (or feature). There are two APIs that help to manage logging for such a component. With <code>{@link jQuery.sap.log.getLogger}(sComponent)</code>, one can retrieve a logger that automatically adds the given <code>sComponent</code> as component parameter to each log entry, if no other component is specified. Typically, JavaScript code will retrieve such a logger once during startup and reuse it for the rest of its lifecycle. Second, the {@link jQuery.sap.log.Logger#setLevel}(iLevel, sComponent) method allows to set the log level for a specific component only. This allows a more fine granular control about the created logging entries. {@link jQuery.sap.log.Logger#getLevel} allows to retrieve the currently effective log level for a given component.\n\n{@link jQuery.sap.log.getLogEntries} returns an array of the currently collected log entries.\n\nFurthermore, a listener can be registered to the log. It will be notified whenever a new entry is added to the log. The listener can be used for displaying log entries in a separate page area, or for sending it to some external target (server).","type":"class","static":true,"visibility":"public","since":"0.9.0"},{"control":"jQuery.sap.util.Properties","text":"Represents a collection of string properties (key/value pairs).\n\nEach key and its corresponding value in the collection is a string, keys are case-sensitive.\n\nUse {@link jQuery.sap.properties} to create an instance of <code>jQuery.sap.util.Properties</code>.\n\nThe {@link #getProperty} method can be used to retrieve a value from the collection, {@link #setProperty} to store or change a value for a key and {@link #getKeys} can be used to retrieve an array of all keys that are currently stored in the collection.","type":"class","static":true,"visibility":"public","since":"0.9.0"},{"control":"jQuery.sap.util.ResourceBundle","text":"Contains locale-specific texts.\n\nIf you need a locale-specific text within your application, you can use the resource bundle to load the locale-specific file from the server and access the texts of it.\n\nUse {@link jQuery.sap.resources} to create an instance of jQuery.sap.util.ResourceBundle. There you have to specify the URL to the base .properties file of a bundle (.properties without any locale information, e.g. \"mybundle.properties\"), and optionally a locale. The locale is defined as a string of the language and an optional country code separated by underscore (e.g. \"en_GB\" or \"fr\").
